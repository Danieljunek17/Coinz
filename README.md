# Coinz

A discord economy bot that has over 25+ ways to make money. We keep updating the bot to add extra features. Coinz uses the latest stable API version of discord.

Want to contribute? Great, we love that! Please take your time on [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Aqua-Solutions2/Coinz/issues/new).


## Self-hosting
We do not recommend self-hosting the bot and website, but it's always an option.

### Self-host Discord Bot
To selfhost the bot yourself, you need to have:
* Node - confirmed working on v16.8.0
* npm - comes with Node, the version shouldn't really matter
* A Discord bot token, and having the bot in your server
* An mongodb.com-database set up, as well as a user to it (with write access)
* A clone of the source code, this can be found [here](https://github.com/SiebeBaree/Coinz) and needs to be extracted to a folder.

We will have to do this once:
* Do `npm i` inside the folder, and wait for it to finish.
* Create a file `.env` in the root of the folder.
* Change `/src/config.json` with your default values.

**Example .env file:** *(Do not use `""` or `''`)*
```
TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
DATABASE_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/coinz
```

After all this, start the bot with `npm run start`.

### Self-host Website
To selfhost the website yourself, you need to have:
* Python - confirmed working on v3.9.6
* pip - comes with Python, the version shouldn't really matter (at least 2.x)
* OAuth2 Redirects setup (You can find the OAuth2 tab in your discord application)
* All packages installed (List of all packages in `/website/requirements.txt`)
* A clone of the source code, this can be found [here](https://github.com/SiebeBaree/Coinz) and needs to be extracted to a folder.

We will have to do this once:
* Rename `example.config.py` to `config.py`.
* Change `config.py` with your default values.

**OAuth2 Redirects:** *(For local testing change `https://www.your-website-here.com` to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`)*
```
https://www.your-website-here.com/callback
https://www.your-website-here.com/dashboard
```

After all this, run `website/coinzbot.py`.

> ### âš  Warning 
> There is literally no warranty if you self-host Coinz, and we will not help you set it up either. If you wish to set the bot and/or website up yourself, we expect you have well enough knowledge in Node.js and Python.
