# Coinz

A discord economy bot that has over 25+ ways to make money. We keep updating the bot to add extra features. Coinz uses the latest stable API version of discord.

## Self-hosting
We do not recommend self-hosting the bot, but it's always an option. To selfhost the bot yourself, you need to have:
* Node - confirmed working on v16.8.0
* npm - comes with Node, the version shouldn't really matter
* A Discord bot token, and having the bot in your server
* An mongodb.com-database set up, as well as a user to it (with write access)
* A clone of the source code, this can be found [here](https://github.com/SiebeBaree/AquaSolutions) and needs to be extracted to a folder.

We will have to do this once:
* Do `npm i` inside the folder, and wait for it to finish.
* Create a file `.env` in the root of the folder.
* Change `/src/config.json` with your default values.

**Example .env file:** *(Do not use `""` or `''`)*
```
TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
DATABASE_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/coinz
```

After all this, start the bot with `npm run start`.

> ### âš  Warning 
> There is literally no warranty if you self-host Coinz, and we will not help you set it up either. If you wish to set the bot up yourself, we expect you have well enough knowledge in Node.js.
